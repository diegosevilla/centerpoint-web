ABSTRACT

Data gathering is one of the most important steps for a research or a study. One of the most used methods is by conducting a survey. This paper presents a cross platform application that would be used by both the researchers and the research participants. It utilizes a web application for creating the survey form that would be  uploaded to a server. It also provides a mobile app where respondents would be able to submit their answer to the survey. The web application also analyzes data gathered and summarizes the result.
